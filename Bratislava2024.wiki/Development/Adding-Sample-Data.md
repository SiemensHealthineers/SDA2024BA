As part of the backend solution, we have implemented a simple CLI application for managing Database and Blob storage data. You can find it under backend/NeuroMedia.Seed project. You can find more information in the README file, or by using the -h or --help option when running the application. Use it to populate the application with some sample data and easier implementing new functionality. The data should be updated whenever needed.
