The aim of this documentation wiki is to describe the architecture of the Federation Learning.

The documentation is based on the [Arc42 template](https://arc42.org/overview)  and was inspired by [Architecture Documentation Wiki](https://roboy-sw-documentation-template.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html). The ideas of [C4 model](https://c4model.com/)  are also applied in some chapters.

Drawing diagrams
We use [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) tool.

[draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) app is a free online diagramming tool that supports a wide range of diagrams with its extensive shape libraries. Create flow charts, UML diagrams, org charts, mind maps, mockups, floor plans, infographics and more.

The diagrams are saved directly to the wiki as PNG with embedded XML . This allows us to edit the diagram in the tool as well as show it directly in wiki without any conversion needed. Avoid using SVGs as these might be rendered differently in the browser comparing to what you see in the draw.io app.

The diagrams shall be stored to the corresponding folder close to the actual documentation. For instance, this Documentation contains the subfolder called Architecture/.diagrams.

The recommended way is to clone this wiki  to your PC and edit the diagrams in [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) directly. Then just commit and push the changes as usual.
