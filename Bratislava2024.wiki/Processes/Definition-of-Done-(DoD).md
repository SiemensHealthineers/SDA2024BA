The Definition of Done (DoD) in software development is a set of criteria that must be met for a product increment (e.g., a user story, feature, or bug fix) to be considered complete and ready for release. The DoD ensures that all work is performed to a consistent standard and that no incomplete or substandard work progresses to the next stage.

## User Story
### Code
- All child tasks (if used) are completed
- All code changes are committed and pushed to the repository based on branching strategy
- Code was reviewed and approved at least by one peer
### Testing
- Unit tests are written and passed
- User acceptance tests (UAT) are performed and passed
### Documentation
- Code is documented, including comments and necessary documentation for future maintenance
- User documentation, including release notes and manuals, is updated if applicable
### Approval
- All Acceptance Criteria are met
- Product Owner or relevant stakeholders have reviewed and approved the changes

**System Language**
As a user of the system, I need the entire system to be in **English** so that I can use it effectively.
