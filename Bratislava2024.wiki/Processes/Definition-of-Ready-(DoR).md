The Definition of Ready (DoR) in software development is a set of criteria that must be met before a product backlog item (e.g., a user story, feature, or bug) is considered ready to be taken into a sprint or development cycle. The DoR ensures that all necessary information is available and that the item is well-prepared for the development team to work on it efficiently.

## User Story
- The item is clearly described, with a detailed understanding of the feature or functionality
- Acceptance criteria are clearly defined and agreed upon
- The item is well-understood by both the development team and the product owner
- The item is small enough to be completed within a single sprint (1 week)
- Development team has estimated the effort required to complete the item
- All dependencies are identified and documented
- Test scenarios are identified
- Relevant user stories, tasks, or epics are linked and traceable
