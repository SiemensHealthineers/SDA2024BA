**Problem description**

Dystonia is one of the frequent diagnoses in neurology. Patients with dystonia
have involuntary muscle spasms and contractions. These lead to twisting or jerky movements
and unusual body positions.
 
Cervical dystonia is manifested by contractions of the neck muscles that lead to abnormal twisting,
bowing, or turning the head, which are often combined with tremors or jerky movements.
Treatment in this case consists of intramuscular administration of botulinum toxin and long-term treatment
monitoring the patient's condition. The effect of botulinum toxin is best assessed with a one-month interval after application.
 
However, due to the busyness of the neurological clinics, the patient often comes for a check-up
too late (waiting times are realistically 3 or more months). As a result, the effect of botulinum toxin application cannot be traced either
set up the correct ongoing treatment.

**Solution**

The proposed application solves the remote control of the patient's condition using a recording
videos, tracking and categorizing patient status and automation of some activities (control reminders, tracking over time, tracking medications, etc.)

**Support** 
A doctor (and at the same time a university professor) from the neurology department is willing to participate
at the Summer Academy in the position of a customer, participate in reviews and provide an introduction
a professional lecture on the issue, as well as ongoing consultation on the application proposal.

**Outputs**
- training project on real use-time
- professional medical lecture on the issue
- the possibility of establishing research/other collaboration
- verification of technologies
- PR
- source code publicly available under MIT license for the needs of the neurology department
